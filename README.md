# Hospital Emergency Room Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Created Using Microsoft Excel)
*Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze hospital emergency room data, track KPIs, and provide actionable insights for better decision-making.*

***

## Project Overview:
We need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Excel using Power Pivot to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving services

***

## KPI’s Requirement:
- **Number of Patients:**
  - Count the total number of patients visiting the ER each day.
  - Show a daily trend with an area sparkline to spot patterns like busy days or seasonal trends.
 
- **Average Wait Time:**
  - Find the average time patients wait to see a medical professional.
  - Use an area sparkline to track daily changes and highlight days with longer wait times that might need improvements.

- **Patient Satisfaction Score:**
  - Check the average daily satisfaction score of patients to assess service quality.
  - Use an area sparkline to show trends, spot drops in satisfaction, and link them to busy times or challenges.
