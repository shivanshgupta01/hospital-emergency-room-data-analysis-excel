## Project Overview:
We need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Excel using Power Pivot to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving services

***

## KPIâ€™s Requirement:
- **Number of Patients:**
  - Count the total number of patients visiting the ER each day.
  - Show a daily trend with an area sparkline to spot patterns like busy days or seasonal trends.
 
- **Average Wait Time:**
  - Find the average time patients wait to see a medical professional.
  - Use an area sparkline to track daily changes and highlight days with longer wait times that might need improvements.

- **Patient Satisfaction Score:**
  - Check the average daily satisfaction score of patients to assess service quality.
  - Use an area sparkline to show trends, spot drops in satisfaction, and link them to busy times or challenges.

## Key Insights (As Per January 2024):

- **Patient Volume Trends:**
  - The ER handled over 500 patients in January, with peak visits on weekends.
  - Daily trend shows noticeable spikes during flu season, suggesting seasonal demand.

- **Average Wait Time:**
  - The average wait time was ~36 minutes, with some days exceeding 45 minutes.
  - Longer wait times directly correlated with higher patient volume.

- **Patient Satisfaction:**
  - Overall satisfaction remained high (4.9/5) despite busy days.
  - Slight dips in satisfaction matched with peak wait times, indicating the need for quicker service during rush hours.

- **Admission vs. Non-Admission:**
  - 52% of patients were admitted, while 48% were discharged after ER treatment.
  -This balance indicates efficient triage and admission practices.

- **Age Distribution:**
  - The 0â€“9 age group accounted for the highest share of visits.
  - Elderly patients (60+) had a higher admission rate, highlighting the need for specialized care readiness.

- **Timeliness of Service:**
  - 74% of patients were seen within 30 minutes, but 26% experienced delays.
  - Improving staff allocation during peak hours could reduce delays.

- **Gender Analysis:**
  - Patient ratio: 53% Female | 47% Male, showing nearly balanced gender distribution.

- **Department Referrals:**
  - Cardiology and Orthopedics received the highest referrals.
  - This indicates the most common emergency cases involved cardiac issues and injuries.

## Dashboard:
- **Excel Interactive Dashboard Shows:**
  - Year Selection
  - Month Wise Data Slicer
  - Number of Patients 
  - Average Wait Time (Minutes)
  - Admission Status
  - Number of Patients by Age Group
  - Patients Attended Status

## Final Conclusion:
The Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Excel provides valuable insights into ER operations.
It highlights patient trends, wait times, satisfaction scores, and admission patterns effectively.
Analysis shows high satisfaction levels but indicates delays during peak hours.
Age and referral insights help in better resource allocation and service planning.
Gender distribution and timeliness tracking ensure balanced and efficient monitoring.
Overall, the dashboard enables data-driven decisions to improve hospital efficiency and patient care.
